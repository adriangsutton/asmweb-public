Aerobatics Over Lake Wanaka is a piece for 6 pianos, performed regularly by the ensemble Piano Circus. "Many years ago while driving in New Zealand on the shores of Lake Wanaka, I saw a sign advertising aerobatics trips. I didn't have time to stop, but this piece was my musical imagining of what such a trip above the lake would be like..  simultaneously scarily exciting and stunningly beautiful."
