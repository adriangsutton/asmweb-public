(extract perf. BBC Symphony Orchestra under Michael Seal)

A Fist Full of Fives is a 10-min orchestral piece using the same line-up as Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Everything in the piece derives from the number 5 in some way!

â€‹Performed originally by the Corinthian Orchestra, it was subsequently performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Seal on BBC Radio 3.
