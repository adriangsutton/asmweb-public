<h2>Trio Dances (2021)</h2>

{% include "hiddenWorkAudioAndPDF.html" %}

<div class="pdMainContent">
    
    <p>
    This is a little suite of three dances for string trio that, in a sense, picks up from where Adrian's violin/viola duo Spring Masque (2012) left off.</p>

    <p>
    <h3>1.Galliard</h3>
    Ever since writing the score for the National Theatre’s production of The Revenger’s Tragedy in 2008, Adrian had fallen in love with a certain kind of Renaissance-inspired sound which infuses the first of these dances. The opening characteristic stress pattern of the 6/8 Galliard metre is used as a platform throughout the movement to explore the thematic material in a series of increasingly frequent modulations.</p>

    <p>
    <h3>2. Sarabande</h3>
    This is based on a simple tune that Adrian wrote many years ago and until now, never found a home for. Adrian has previously noted how composition frequently works like that.. ideas get tucked away in a drawer, waiting for their right moment. Each of the three instruments gets a turn with the melodic material.</p>

    <p>
    <h3>3. Rigaudon</h3>
    An earthy, robust dance in 2/4 time to round the suite off.. though containing some contrapuntal passage work to give the players a workout!</p>
