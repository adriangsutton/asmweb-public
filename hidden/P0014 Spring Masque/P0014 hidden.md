    Spring Masque celebrates the joyous energy of a violin and a viola in duet.</p>
    
    <p>Limiting one's resources like this presents an invigorating challenge: to squeeze a complete musical environment out of two instruments.. rhythm, harmony, melody, invigorating figurations.. all in a way that is (hopefully) both engaging to listen to, and play.</p>

    <p>
    Composers sometimes pre-meditate how a piece is going to work, and plan it out in meticulous detail before writing any actual notes. Spring Masque was different; it was written bar-to-bar, in a process of organic development and with no preconception, and was written with the instruments in my hands.  I swapped between violin and viola, inventing short phrases and figurations to see how they worked together, gradually extending the piece as I worked. </p>

    <p>
    It takes the form of an energetic dance, derived loosely from the idea of 16th-century masque.</p>

    <p>
    Fenella Humphreys and Andrew Berridge have recorded Spring Masque as part of their disc Reels, Drones and Jigs released on the Champs Hill label.</p>
