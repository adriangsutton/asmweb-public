            <p>Adrian is a British internationally-recognised orchestral, chamber and theatre music composer. </p>
            <p>
            His <a href="/works/P0038/">Violin Concerto</a> recently received its world premiere to a standing ovation at London’s Southbank Centre, played by soloist Fenella Humphreys and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</p>
            <p>
            He's received commissions from many areas of the classical music world including the BBC Proms, and has worked with the UK's top orchestras including the RPO, BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBCCO, RSNO and Opera North. </p>
            <p>
            As the composer of the orchestral score for the National Theatre's runaway success <i>War Horse</i>, Adrian has enjoyed unparalleled success simultaneously as a classical and theatre composer.</p>
            <p>
            Growing up immersed in the world of large scale orchestral music both as a player in South Africa’s leading youth string orchestra and surround by music at home, orchestral music is in his DNA.</p>
            <p>
            Following formal training at Goldsmiths University in London, his musical style is accessible to all, with performers deriving as much pleasure playing his energized and lyrical lines, as audiences are delighted by his expansive harmonies and strong melodies.</p>
            <p>
            He’s a strong advocate of live music being performed for the enjoyment of both the performers and the audience; a unique moment to be shared and remembered.
