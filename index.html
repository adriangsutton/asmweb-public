        <p>Adrian is a British internationally-recognised orchestral and chamber music composer. His Violin Concerto recently received its world premiere to a three-minute standing ovation at London’s Southbank Centre, played by soloist Fenella Humphreys and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He's received commissions from many areas of the classical music world including the BBC Proms, and has worked with some of the most distinguished orchestras in the world, including the RPO (the recent concert was their fifth collaboration) and BBC Symphony Orchestra amongst many others.</p>

<p>

    Growing up immersed in the world of large scale orchestral music both as a player in South Africa’s leading youth string orchestra and surround by music at home, orchestral music is in his DNA. Following formal training at Goldsmiths University in London, his musical style is accessible to all, with performers deriving as much pleasure playing as do audiences being swept away by his expansive harmonies and strong melodies. He’s a strong advocate of live music being performed for the enjoyment of both the performers and the audience; a unique moment to be shared and remembered.
