                <h2>Orchestral Miniatures (2023)</h2>
<div class="pdMainContent">
    <p>
    The following items are a selection of miniatures that can be combined into a suite or played on their own. Ever pragmatic, Adrian had in mind their use as light programme-fillers, prêt-à-porter pieces for any occasion. The orchestra can select their own wardrobe.
    Some of the set are theatre cues that have been repurposed and given a new lease of life, expanded and rearranged for symphony orchestra.</p>

    <h3>Intermezzo</h3>

    This music was originally composed for Husbands and Sons, an adaptation of D.H. Lawrence’s mining plays staged at the National Theatre in 2015. Director Marianne Elliott describes it as ‘a story about the uncomplicated identity of mining men clashing with the trapped, frustrated and aspiring souls of the women they leave behind.’
    Adrian’s initial task was to capture that yearning and unfulfilled aspiration in the women, their desire to escape the drudgery of the everyday and find adventure. Intermezzo is the result of essaying the right style, language and romanticism to express such intimate themes. In the end, the play’s music was constrained to darker tones, so this material did not get used.
    The concert version of Intermezzo is a rhapsody that plunges you straight into a maelstrom of repressed emotion. The writing recalls Mahler or Strauss, with the same elastic timing. Wide melodic intervals - reaching from low note to high - give romantic reach to the phrases, while chromatic harmonies add to the sense of unrest and inner turmoil.
    Within just a few pages of score, Intermezzo gives us a glimpse of a rich internal world, the collective vulnerability and rawness of emotion that lay beneath a life of hardship and Edwardian mores.</p>

<h3>Dr. Semmelweis</h3>

In the mid-nineteenth century, doctors would routinely do autopsies then wipe their hands cursorily on their aprons before getting on with their morning rounds. Not even a swill under the tap, let alone soap. Unsurprisingly, patients exposed to the teeming bacteria succumbed to rampant infections and died.
Enter Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, who suspects there is some kind of contamination and encourages basic hand-washing hygiene.
He is mocked by his illustrious medical colleagues, who put the deaths down to a bad dose of ‘bad
air’ (miasma) and other such spurious causes. Emboldened by what he sees as clear evidence, Semmelweis perseveres, but the constant suspicion and scorn from his peers leave him feeling isolated and facing a nervous breakdown.
Adrian composed music to be played live to the dramatisation of this story, which starred Mark Rylance and premiered in the Bristol Old Vic at the tail-end of the pandemic (aptly enough).
The Tarantella-style dance picks up on period style while having a modern, manic energy. The perpetual motion represents the unstoppable spread of the bacteria, with each section of the orchestra outdoing each other in malevolent glee. Accented gestures and a breathless, stamping choreography underline the urgency of Semmelweis’ quest and his despair at all the warnings going unheard and unheeded.</p></p>

<h3>Polperro Beach</h3>

This music comes from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (2016 play adaptation), and was originally composed for a studio combination of electric guitars, vocal humming, strings, piano and digital sounds.
The scene this accompanies from the play is when Christopher, a gifted teenage mathematician with Asperger’s, remembers the happiness and freedom of his holidays with his mum on a beach in Cornwall. It is a rare moment of peace when his mind isn’t systematising, fretting or reimagining the world in mathematical relationships. On that beach in Polperro, safe in his mother’s love, he feels free.
Over a slow rise and fall in the strings, clarinets overlap in a wave-like motif. The beach feels empty but graced with sun. As if basking in the specialness of that, the violins play the main theme. It is one
of the most beautiful, most felicitous melodies in all of Adrian’s repertoire, fourteen bars of sheer happiness.
The waves build and crest briefly before slipping back into the calm. It makes you want to be there, in Polperro, feeling the sun and knowing that all will be well.</p></p>

<h3>Gigue from Coram Boy</h3>

The theatrical adaptation of Jamila Gavin’s Coram Boy opened to great acclaim in the Olivier Theatre in 2005 and has been restaged many times since. Adrian’s music plays such a large role that it was almost deemed a musical, but ended up being called a ‘play with music.’
One of the main characters, the adolescent Alex, has a wonderful voice and wants to pursue music as a career. However, when he sings a song at a family performance his voice breaks at the crucial moment. It is a disaster for Alex but ‘a cause to celebrate’ for his father, Lord Ashbrook, who sees his son’s future firmly in the family business and not the Arts. Of course.
As if to brush away Alex’s embarrassment in the scene, Adrian composed this jolly segue. The strings bounce along in a pastiche of a baroque jig, resetting the mood with bright trills and neat skips. Nothing to see here, the music seems to say, everything is fine and dandy, and life on the Ashbrook estate can carry on as normal.</p></p>

<h3>Not Norwegian Dance</h3>

This is a treat for anybody who is nostalgic for British Light Music and those frivolous but highly crafted pieces by composers such as Eric Coates, Ronald Binge and Eric Fenby. Their works often featured on the BBC Light Programme and lifted the spirits after World War Two.
The dance commemorates an important milestone in Adrian’s career, as it is his very first complete piece, performed in concert when he was still a young teenager. Back then, he wrote it for violin and piano as a humorous pastiche of Norwegian music, with a heavy nod towards Grieg and his character pieces.
Coming back to this treasured piece of juvenilia to orchestrate it, Adrian recognised that a lot of the ideas were not, in fact, quite so Nordic as he initially thought, and so retitled it.
In its orchestral clothes it still strikes a pretty Scandinavian picture, and is a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the rustic folk styles so prized by Grieg. There are also echoes of the joie-de-vivre and musical anarchy of Milhaud and his compatriots. Wherever you trace its roots, it makes for a great party piece.</p></p>
